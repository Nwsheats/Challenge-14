      "contents": "Ember has seen massive stagnation over past 5 years and faces obscurity in future. Big companies like Netflix and Airbnb have dumped ember and moved to other frameworks like react. Ember has a very poor support offering due to a shrinking community and is plagued with outdated resources. Too complex to be implemented in small projects. Takes too much time to configure and use which eats away into productivity. In comparison to react and Vue, ember is extremely complicated and difficult to learn especially for beginners."
